Welcome to Trace37 Labs. This is where I'll be publishing security research, vulnerability writeups, and tool releases. I am currently tidying up a lot of work that has sat on my private GitHub repo.

## What to Expect

- Deep technical analysis of vulnerabilities
- Exploitation techniques and proof-of-concepts
- Tool releases and documentation
- General security musings

Stay tuned.
