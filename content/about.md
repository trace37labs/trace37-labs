# Trace37 Labs

**Independent security research · Break to build · Disclose to protect**

We discover vulnerabilities in critical software infrastructure through methodical research and responsible disclosure. Our findings help secure ecosystems used by millions.

## Research Philosophy

We believe in **transparency through coordination**. All vulnerabilities are:
1. **Responsibly disclosed** to maintainers first
2. **Patched before publication** (when possible)
3. **Documented clearly** for community benefit
4. **Never weaponized** or sold for offensive purposes

## Core Expertise

### Offensive Security Research
- Web application vulnerability discovery
- API security testing & fuzzing
- Cloud infrastructure misconfiguration analysis
- Reverse engineering & binary analysis
- Proof-of-concept exploit development

### Emerging Technologies
- AI/ML system security analysis
- Software supply chain security
- DevSecOps pipeline assessment
- Container & orchestration security

## Advisories & Disclosures

### Published CVEs
*Coming soon as maintainers confirm disclosures*

### Pending Responsible Disclosure
- Handlebars.js Denial of Service vulnerability (under vendor review)
- Additional undisclosed findings with affected vendors

**Disclosure Policy:** We adhere to a 90-day coordinated disclosure timeline and follow established industry practices for vulnerability reporting.

## Why "Trace37"?
*Trace* represents the investigative process of security research. *37* ... well, that requires a full blog post. Together, we trace the path from vulnerability to remediation.

## Connect & Collaborate
