## Trace37 Labs

**Security Research | Exploit Development | Advanced Testing**

## What We Do
We identify security flaws in complex systems through:
- **Offensive Research**: Discovering novel attack vectors
- **Deep Analysis**: Reverse engineering and binary exploitation  
- **Modern Stack Security**: Cloud, APIs, and AI/ML systems
- **Practical Defense**: Transforming findings into actionable fixes

## Why It Matters
In today's landscape, security through obscurity is dead. We provide the adversarial perspective needed to build truly resilient systems.

### Responsible Disclosure

I follow responsible disclosure practices. Vendors are given 90 days to address issues before public disclosure unless the vulnerability is already being actively exploited.
