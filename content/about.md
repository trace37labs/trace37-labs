**Independent security research · Break to build · Disclose to protect**

We discover vulnerabilities in critical software infrastructure through methodical research and responsible disclosure. Our findings help secure ecosystems used by millions.

---

## Research Philosophy

We believe in transparency through coordination. All vulnerabilities are responsibly disclosed to maintainers first, patched before publication when possible, documented clearly for community benefit, and never weaponized or sold for offensive purposes.

---

## Core Expertise

**Offensive Security Research** — Web application vulnerability discovery, API security testing and fuzzing, cloud infrastructure misconfiguration analysis, reverse engineering and binary analysis, proof-of-concept exploit development.

**Emerging Technologies** — AI/ML system security analysis, software supply chain security, DevSecOps pipeline assessment, container and orchestration security.

---

## Advisories & Disclosures

**Published CVEs** — Coming soon as maintainers confirm disclosures.

**Pending Responsible Disclosure** — Handlebars.js Denial of Service vulnerability (under vendor review), plus additional undisclosed findings with affected vendors.

We adhere to a 90-day coordinated disclosure timeline and follow established industry practices for vulnerability reporting.
